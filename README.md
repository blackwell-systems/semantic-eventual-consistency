Research on coordination-free convergence in distributed systems through **normalization confluence** - a third structural regime alongside operation commutativity (CRDTs) and invariant confluence.

## Overview

Traditional approaches to coordination-free convergence require either:
1. **Operation commutativity** (CRDTs) - operations must be designed to commute
2. **Invariant confluence** - operations must preserve invariants in all orderings

This research identifies a third regime: **normalization confluence**, where operations may be non-commutative and may violate invariants, yet systems converge through compensation. The key insight is that convergence is a property of the normalization rewrite system (event application + invariant repair), not the operations themselves.

This repository contains theoretical foundations, proofs, and companion verification tools.

### Normalization Confluence in Federated Registry Networks

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18677400.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18677400)

**Extended version with federated systems**

Extends normalization confluence to multi-organizational environments where registries are connected by morphisms encoding cross-organizational semantic constraints. For tree-shaped morphism networks (directed forests), proves federated convergence requires only validity preservation of the morphisms - all other conditions derive from network acyclicity via an authority argument: the source's unique normal form deterministically fixes the target's shared component.

Includes self-contained treatment of single-registry model (governance rewrite system, convergence theorem via Newman's Lemma, necessity results, complexity analysis, and verification calculus).

### Normalization Confluence for Registry-Governed Stream Processing

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18671870.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18671870)

**Core single-registry foundation**

Identifies normalization confluence as a third regime for coordination-free convergence in distributed systems. Formalizes registry-governed stream processing, proves termination and confluence under well-founded compensation (WFC) and compensation commutativity (CC), and develops a verification calculus for practical CC checking. Shows uniformly bounded compensation (UBC) yields constant per-event overhead matching conventional stream processing.

## Key Concepts

### Normalization Confluence

A coordination-free convergence regime where:
- **Operations may violate invariants** (unlike invariant confluence)
- **Operations need not commute** (unlike CRDTs)
- **Compensation restores validity** after each operation
- **Compensated results commute** even though operations don't

Under two conditions - well-founded compensation (WFC) and compensation commutativity (CC) - all processors consuming the same events converge to the same valid state regardless of application order.

### Registry-Governed Streams

A **registry** is any authoritative definition of validity external to the stream processor: policy engines, constraint services, schema validators, compliance controllers. The registry provides:
- **Invariant predicates** defining valid states
- **Compensation operator** repairing violations deterministically

Events are applied in any order; the registry normalizes states after each event. The governance rewrite system interleaves event application with compensation.

### Federated Registries

Multiple registries connected by **morphisms** encoding cross-organizational constraints. A manufacturer's specifications constrain supplier capabilities; a regulator's rules constrain bank behavior.

For **tree-shaped networks** (directed forests where each non-root has one incoming morphism), federated convergence follows from component convergence + morphism validity preservation. The **authority argument** eliminates nondeterminism: source normal forms deterministically control target shared components.

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/blackwell-systems/gsm.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blackwell-systems/gsm)

**Go library for building verified convergent state machines**

- Build-time WFC/CC verification via exhaustive state-space enumeration
- O(1) runtime event application through precomputed lookup tables
- Fluent builder API for defining state machines in Go code
- Portable JSON export for multi-language runtime support

```go
machine, report, err := builder.Build()
// Convergence: GUARANTEED (verified exhaustively)

s = machine.Apply(s, "ship_item") // O(1) table lookup
```

### nccheck - Normalization Confluence Verifier

**YAML-based verification tool for finite-state registry specifications**

Reference implementation proving the verification procedure from the paper is mechanizable. Exhaustively checks WFC and CC for registry specs, provides counterexamples when convergence fails.

```bash
nccheck examples/disjoint.yaml      # PASS - independent subsystems
nccheck examples/permissions.yaml   # FAIL - cross-variable invariants
```

## Three Regimes of Coordination-Free Convergence

| Regime | Requirement | Guarantees | Design Space |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **Operation Commutativity** (CRDTs) | Operations commute algebraically | Convergence without coordination | Commutative operations only |
| **Invariant Confluence** | Operations preserve invariants in all orderings | Convergence without repair | Invariant-preserving operations only |
| **Normalization Confluence** | Compensated results commute (operations need not) | Convergence through repair | Non-commutative, invariant-violating operations |

Normalization confluence occupies the gap between CRDTs (requires commutativity) and I-confluence (requires invariant preservation). It permits operations that satisfy neither, provided compensation commutes.

## Future Work

This repository will include:
- **Federation verification** - Multi-registry convergence checking
- **Runtime monitoring** - Divergence detection for production systems
- **Compensation strategies** - Patterns for achieving CC in common scenarios
- **Case studies** - Real-world applications of normalization confluence
